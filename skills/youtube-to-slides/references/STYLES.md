- **Colors:** Aged yellowed parchment, dark brown and sepia ink, occasional red-brown accents
- **Layout:** Asymmetric hand-drawn layout with ornate calligraphy and scattered annotations
- **Visuals:** Detailed pen-and-ink sketches — gears, pulleys, botanical cross-sections, geometric constructions

**Best for:** Educational content, science/engineering topics, history, thoughtful analysis pieces.

## magazine

**Fashion editorial magazine spread**

High-fashion editorial spread inspired by Vogue, Harper's Bazaar, and W Magazine. Big dramatic headlines with extreme size contrast, asymmetrical layouts mixing photography and text, styled pull quotes, and drop caps. Confident, luxurious, and visually striking.

- **Colors:** Sophisticated palette — stark black and white with a single pop color (crimson, electric pink, or gold), or rich tonal range (burgundy, cream, charcoal). Generous white space as a design element
- **Layout:** Asymmetrical editorial spread with oversized condensed headline, key points in elegant columns alongside feature imagery, dramatic pull quotes in large italic/serif type, mixed type sizes creating visual rhythm
- **Visuals:** Large editorial-style images or illustrations as visual anchors, text wrapping around imagery, drop caps, thin rule lines framing pull quotes, layered and intentional composition like an actual magazine page

**Best for:** Business topics, interviews, fashion/lifestyle content, professional and visually luxurious presentations.

## comic

**Vibrant comic book / pop art style**

Bold black outlines, Ben-Day dots, starburst shapes, speech bubbles, and dynamic diagonal compositions. High energy and visually striking.

## geek

**College bulletin board / dorm room aesthetic**

Kraft paper and corkboard background with a mix of handwritten marker text, typed index cards, photos, sticky notes, stickers, and doodles. Deliberately messy and personal.

- **Colors:** Warm cork/kraft paper base, neon sticky notes (pink, yellow, green, blue), red/blue marker, black Sharpie, highlighter yellow
- **Layout:** Deliberately messy collage, black marker headline at top center, key points on sticky notes/index cards, red string connections, torn notebook page at bottom

**Best for:** Study notes, brainstorming summaries, creative topics, personal/informal content.

## chalkboard

**Real black classroom chalkboard**

A photograph-realistic black chalkboard with a worn wooden frame. ALL text is handwritten in chalk — loose, natural human handwriting with personality. Real chalk with authentic hand pressure — thick downstrokes, thin upstrokes, chalk skipping on rough slate. Looks like a photo of a lecture hall blackboard after an incredible class.

- **Colors:** True matte black surface (not green), white chalk with natural brightness variation, occasional yellow or pale blue chalk used sparingly, faint ghosting of previously erased content
- **Layout:** Organic lecture-notes layout filling the board naturally, title handwritten large at top with underline, handwritten numbered or bulleted key points drifting slightly, boxed summary near bottom, wooden chalk tray visible at bottom edge
- **Visuals:** ALL text in handwritten chalk style — no typed or digital fonts. Physically realistic chalk on slate with grain texture, eraser smudges, fine chalk dust, subtle board wear and scratches

**Best for:** Lectures, technical explanations, academic topics, step-by-step breakdowns.

## collage

**Dreamcore ASCII collage**

Surreal mixed-media digital collage layering ASCII art, handwritten scrawls, cut-out imagery, and glitched gradients. ALL text is handwritten — scratchy, uneven, like someone writing with a marker on scraps of paper. Background varies freely (light, dark, pastel, or mixed). Late-night internet meets liminal spaces — like a zine made by an insomniac programmer in a half-dream state.

- **Colors:** Varied backgrounds (washed-out cream, pastel gradients, deep navy, pale sky blue, or mixed collage textures), terminal green and phosphor amber as accent elements in ASCII fragments, soft pastel dreamcore washes, harsh handwritten text overlays, occasional magenta/cyan glitch streaks
- **Layout:** Deliberately fragmented collage — title handwritten large and loose off-center, key points as handwritten snippets on torn paper scraps with ASCII box-drawing borders, summary handwritten in a terminal-inspired block, overlapping layers at different depths
- **Visuals:** ALL text in handwritten style — no clean digital typography. ASCII box-drawing frames mixed with handwriting, dreamy photographic cutouts (empty hallways, clouds, geometric shapes), CRT scanline texture, small surreal fragments (staircase to nowhere, pixelated eye, wireframe sphere)

**Best for:** Tech/internet culture, creative essays, mood-driven content, experimental or artistic topics.

## newspaper

**Vintage newspaper broadsheet**

Crisp black and white newspaper from the early 20th century. Bold serif headlines, dense multi-column layouts, and detailed engraving-style illustrations on clean white newsprint. The gravitas of The New York Times circa 1920s-1940s.

- **Colors:** Strictly black ink on clean white paper — no color, no yellowing, no sepia tint. Rich dense blacks for headlines, medium gray for body text, pure white background
- **Layout:** Traditional newspaper column layout with bold full-width serif headline, secondary deck headline, 2-3 justified columns with thin vertical rules, engraving illustration anchoring one column, boxed pull quote or sidebar, page/edition number in header
- **Visuals:** Detailed engraving-style illustrations (crosshatched portraits, technical diagrams, architectural views) resembling woodcut or steel-plate prints, bold serif typography with thick/thin stroke contrast, thin hairline rules, dense information-rich composition

**Best for:** History, journalism, serious analysis, authoritative and classic presentations.
