## chalkboard

**Classic classroom chalkboard**

Chalk on a dark green slate board with realistic chalk texture — dusty, slightly uneven strokes. Handwritten chalk lettering, diagrams, and annotations like a brilliant professor's lecture notes.

- **Layout:** Lecture-style layout with bold chalk title and wavy underline at top, numbered or bulleted key points, connecting arrows and brackets, summary in a chalk-drawn box at bottom
